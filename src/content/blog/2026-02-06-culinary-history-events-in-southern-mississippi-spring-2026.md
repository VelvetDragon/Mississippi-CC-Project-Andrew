The next few months are jam-packed with culinary events that those of you who live in southern Mississippi might be interesting in attending. There will be everything from community dinners to culinary exhibits to scholarly talks. 

Two exhibits on food recently opened in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The Sixth Street Museum District is hosting “Where Smoke Meets Soul,” a retrospective on Leatha’s Bar-B-Que Inn. Leatha’s was founded in Foxworth, Mississippi, in the 1970s and later moved to Hattiesburg. Although the restaurant is now closed, Leatha Jackson’s rich style of barbecue was unique to southern Mississippi and earned her the title “Queen of Barbecue.” This long-overdue retrospective is open on Thursdays and Fridays from 11am to 2pm, and Saturdays from noon to 2pm at the Historic Eureka School and will remain open through April 25.

University Libraries at Southern Miss in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, currently has an exhibit (which I helped to create alongside Jennifer Brannock, Curator of Rare Books and Mississippiana) on community and cookbooks. The exhibit features the newest addition to the culinary collection, fifteen early-twentieth-century British community cookbooks, and situates them in conversation with similar American community cookbooks. But community was never limited to community cookbooks, and the exhibit also displays works that explore the ways vegetarians, African Americans, and ethnic Americans used cookbooks to create and celebrate identity. The exhibit is open until March 5. There will be a coffee chat on March 5 to close the exhibit at 10am. The exhibit is housed in the McCain Library and Archives at Southern Miss.

Meanwhile, as part of a series called “Cooking Up History,” the Sixth Street Museum District is holding culinary-related events during Black History Month and beyond to celebrate America’s 250 anniversary commemorations. You can learn more about these events at https://sixthstreetmuseumdistrict.com/events/black-history-month/

Here are some highlights!

Coming to the Table: A Community Culinary Celebration. Family-style soul food will be served while dinner guests will participate in guided discussions about food and its importance in Black households. February 12 at 6pm in the cafeteria of the Historic Eureka School; you will need to register and pay a five dollar fee online.

Carried by Courage, Seasoned by History: The Legacy of John Seagraves. John Seagraves served aboard the most decorated American battleship of World War II and went on to have a successful career as a cook. Seagraves’ son and biographer will recount the story of his father. The event will be held at the African American Military History in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on February 19 at 5:30pm and is free and open to the public.

Baked into American Cuisine: James Hemings. Featuring a documentary on James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved cook, and a mac & cheese bake-off competition, this event will be held on February 21 at 1pm at the Historic Eureka School. The event is free, but if you are interested in joining the competition, you should register online no later than February 13.

Following Black History month, the Sixth Street Historic District will be holding additional culinary events including a celebration of Jazz and cuisine in the 1920s and a panel discussion about the role of food in the Civil Rights Movement.
