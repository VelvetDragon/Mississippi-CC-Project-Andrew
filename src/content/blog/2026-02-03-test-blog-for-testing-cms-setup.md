excerpt: Test Blog for testing CMS Setup

This site is an introduction to the community-created cookbooks that shaped Mississippi’s history in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century. It features statistics on “known” Mississippi cookbooks, information on the archives that house these cookbooks, and essays about Mississippi foodways. At its official launch in December 2025, there are two essays in the “Experimental Kitchen” page that use our database of 20,000 recipes.

One is about chicken spaghetti and the other, a massive three-part series, is about pecan pie. I will update this part of the site every so often and, when I do, I will post an announcement in the blog. I will also provide shorter essays on food, cookbooks, and culture in the blog “Culinary Tales” on a more regular basis (at least every other month).
