# AI Insights

The University of Southern Mississippi hosts one of the largest statewide collections of community cookbooks in the United States (at least in proportion to the number of cookbooks published). Over a hundred of those cookbooks have been digitized and are available from Southern Miss' University Libraries.

Suwan Aryal, a talented undergraduate computer scientist at Southern Miss, and I have used artificial intelligence to parse and explore these digitized texts. As we do, we will share some of our findings on this page.

## AI-Powered Analysis

Using machine learning and natural language processing, we are able to analyze patterns in recipe names, ingredients, cooking methods, and cultural references across the entire collection of digitized cookbooks. This allows us to identify trends and connections that would be impossible to detect through traditional research methods.

## Future Insights

As our AI analysis continues, we will share:
- Recipe pattern analysis
- Ingredient trend mapping
- Cultural reference identification
- Publication pattern recognition
- Community network analysis
