# About

## Andrew P. Haley
**Associate Professor of History**  
**The University of Southern Mississippi**

This website and all its errors is the work of Andrew P. Haley, an associate professor of history at The University of Southern Mississippi. His research focuses on community cookbooks as a lens for understanding how women shaped local life in the American South.

## Research Focus

Professor Haley's work examines community cookbooks not just as culinary artifacts, but as historical documents that reveal the social, political, and cultural dynamics of Mississippi communities throughout the 20th century. Through careful analysis of hundreds of cookbooks, he traces how women used these publications to fund community projects, organize social movements, and shape local identity.
