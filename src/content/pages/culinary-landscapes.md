# Culinary Landscapes

Explore the geographical distribution and cultural significance of community cookbooks across Mississippi.

## Database Overview

The following analysis is drawn from a database of approximately 350 community cookbooks that were published between 1890 and 1969 in Mississippi. This master list includes cookbooks that I have collected (and now part of The University of Southern Mississippi's cookbook collection), cookbooks preserved by libraries, and, in a few cases, cookbooks that I know from newspaper coverage were published but I have not seen and may no longer exist. Where verifiable information on the descriptive category (such as the organization that published the cookbook) was not available, I've excluded it from my statistical profile so the number of cookbooks used for each profile differs.
