# Database Overview

The following analysis is drawn from a database of approximately 350 community cookbooks that were published between 1890 and 1969 in Mississippi. This master list includes cookbooks that I have collected (and now part of The University of Southern Mississippi's cookbook collection), cookbooks preserved by libraries, and, in a few cases, cookbooks that I know from newspaper coverage were published but I have not seen and may no longer exist. Where verifiable information on the descriptive category (such as the organization that published the cookbook) was not available, I've excluded it from my statistical profile so the number of cookbooks used for each profile differs.

## Cookbooks by Decade

The number of cookbooks published in Mississippi increased decade by decade. The first cookbook published in the state was the *Spinning-Wheel Cook-Book of Old Southern Recipes* published by the Spinning Wheel Club in Woodville, Mississippi, in 1899. (The cookbook was preserved when it was reprinted in the 1939 and then again in 1983.) It was the only community cookbook published before 1900. However, the numbers grew steadily and in the 1960s over 148 cookbooks were published.

The authors of these cookbooks often did not date their cookbooks, presumably hoping that these cookbooks would be viewed as timeless and could be sold for years if not dated. Even the rise of national publishers after World War II did not lead to the regular dating of cookbooks. Just over 160 of the cookbooks included in the following chart included a printed date.

Previous studies have dated the cookbooks based on their appearance and, especially for nationally produced cookbooks, this technique is not without merit. However, given the importance of demonstrating change over time for this study, I have done my best to research undated cookbooks. Using contributors' names, advertisers, and newspaper references I have dated most of these cookbooks or, at least, have narrowed the possible date so that I can be fairly certain of the decade when it was produced. Nonetheless, the dates below are in some cases estimates and are subject to revision.

## Cookbooks by Organization Type

Community cookbooks were published by a wide variety of organizations, each with different motivations and audiences. Church groups were the most prolific publishers, followed by civic organizations and women's clubs.

## Geographic Distribution

The geographic distribution of cookbook publication reveals interesting patterns about community organization and cultural activity across Mississippi. Urban areas and county seats tended to produce more cookbooks, reflecting both population density and organizational capacity.

## Publication Patterns

Analysis of publication patterns reveals seasonal trends, with many cookbooks published in the fall and winter months, likely timed for holiday sales and fundraising campaigns.

## Research Methodology

This analysis is based on systematic collection and cataloging of community cookbooks from libraries, archives, and private collections across Mississippi. Each cookbook has been examined for publication information, organizational affiliation, and content analysis.
