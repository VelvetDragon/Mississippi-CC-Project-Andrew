      <p>The University of Southern Mississippi hosts one of the largest statewide collections of community cookbooks in the United States (at least in proportion to the number of cookbooks published). Over a hundred of those cookbooks have been digitized and are available from Southern Miss' University Libraries.</p>

      <p>Suwan Aryal, a talented undergraduate computer scientist at Southern Miss, and I have used artificial intelligence to parse and explore these digitized texts. </p>

      <h2>Data Collection & Processing Pipeline</h2>
      <p>Suwan Aryal developed a sophisticated pipeline to extract and process recipes from digitized cookbooks. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:</p>

          <div class="essay-inner">
            <h4>Technical Stack and Implementation</h4>
            <p>The data collection and processing pipeline was built using Python as the primary programming language. The system leverages several key libraries and technologies to extract, process, and structure recipe data from historical PDF cookbooks.</p>

            <h4>PDF Extraction and OCR Processing</h4>
            <p>The pipeline begins with PDF extraction, where each cookbook is converted into individual page images containing recipes. These images are processed through optical character recognition (OCR) using pytesseract, a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR engine. The OCR process transforms visual pages into machine-readable text, enabling automated extraction of recipe content.</p>

            <p>The PDF extraction phase presents unique challenges with historical documents. Many of these cookbooks were scanned from physical copies, resulting in varying image quality, page orientations, and occasional artifacts like creases, stains, or handwritten annotations. Each PDF must be carefully parsed to identify recipe boundaries, separating actual recipe content from headers, footers, page numbers, and other non-recipe text. The OCR output is often imperfect—character recognition errors are common, especially with older fonts, faded text, or decorative typography common in community cookbooks from the 1960s through 1990s.</p>

            <h4>AI Processing with Google Gemini</h4>
            <p>Each page of text is then processed using Google Gemini AI, which applies advanced filtering, cleaning, and correction techniques to standardize measurements, ingredient names, and cooking instructions. The AI handles variations in historical terminology, converts old measurement systems to modern equivalents, and ensures consistency across different cookbooks and time periods.</p>

            <p>The AI processing stage is where the raw OCR text becomes structured, usable data. Gemini AI performs several critical transformations: it identifies recipe components (title, ingredients, instructions, servings), extracts structured information from free-form text, and normalizes data across different formats. For example, it recognizes that "1 cup flour," "1 c. flour," and "one cup of flour" all represent the same measurement. It standardizes historical measurements—converting "1 pint" to "2 cups" or recognizing that older recipes might use "1 teacup" which needs modern conversion. The AI also handles regional variations in ingredient names (like "bell pepper" vs. "sweet pepper") and cooking terminology that has evolved over decades. Perhaps most importantly, it corrects OCR errors by understanding context—if OCR misreads "2 cups sugar" as "2 cups sug@r," the AI can infer the correct word from the recipe context.</p>

            <h4>Database Creation and Consolidation</h4>
            <p>After individual processing, all extracted JSON data is combined into a single comprehensive file, creating a unified recipe database. This consolidated dataset enables powerful search capabilities and cross-cookbook analysis that would be impossible with traditional manual methods.</p>

            <p>The final consolidation phase merges thousands of individual recipe JSON files into one master database. Each recipe in the unified database includes metadata like source cookbook, publication decade, contributor information (when available), and standardized recipe components. This structure enables sophisticated queries that would be impractical manually—we can search for all recipes containing specific ingredients across all cookbooks, analyze how cooking techniques evolved over time, identify regional variations in recipe names, or track the popularity of certain dishes across different decades and communities. The database currently contains recipes spanning several decades, representing the culinary heritage of communities throughout Mississippi, and it continues to grow as more cookbooks are digitized and processed.</p>

      <h2>Research Findings & Analysis</h2>
      <p>The combined JSON database has proven invaluable for analyzing different culinary trends and patterns across Mississippi's community cookbook history. Here are some of the key findings that Suwan and I have analyzed and discovered:</p>

            <p>Craig Claiborne, the <em>New York Times</em> restaurant critic, lived in Indianola, Mississippi, in 1920s and 30s where his mother ran a boarding house and had a reputation as an excellent cook. In 1975, during an interview with WOR in New York, he was asked about his favorite childhood food. It was chicken spaghetti. The interview sparked interest in the curious "Mississippi" dish and a few weeks later Claiborne published his <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019165-my-mothers-chicken-spaghetti" target="_blank">family's recipe in the Times</a>. He claimed it was his mother's invention, and this variation probably was.</p>

            <p>Claiborne saw chicken spaghetti as a distinctly southern dish and Mississippians often view it as their own, but there is every reason to believe it first became popular in the Midwest and made its way down the Mississippi River to the Magnolia State sometime in the early 20th century. Although endless variations exist, it is rooted in both Italian cacciatore and Italian American tetrazzini. (I am planning a more extensive discussion of the historical roots of Chicken Spaghetti for a latter blog post, so we will leave it at that for now.)</p>

            <p>Recipes for chicken spaghetti evolved during the twentieth century, so dating the first appearance in a Mississippi community cookbook is tricky, but a pair of recipes from the mid-1920s are prime contenders. (See note.) In 1926 the Ladies Aid Society of the M. E. Church South of Augusta, Mississippi produced a cookbook to raise funds for "parsonage and church work." Two recipes for chicken spaghetti appear in the "Meats" section, and these relatively simple recipes are true to the churchwomen's promise that the cookbook would feature recipes that would "meet the wants of the average family." (4)</p>

            <p>The first recipe, a one-pot "Chicken with Spaghetti," was submitted by Mrs. J. D. Lugg. Cooks are asked to combine a package of spaghetti, flour, butter, pepper, a "small chicken boiled tender," and an egg, and boil the mix for an hour. (10) The second recipe was submitted by the committee that created the cookbook. Although the committee claimed that all the recipes in the cookbook were "tested and found satisfactory," one suspects that the committee had some doubts about Mrs. Lugg's one-pot recipe (as do I) and felt the need to include an alternative. The committee's recipe, "Chicken and Spaghetti," invites the homemaker to "prepare a chicken as for stew. Cook until tender. Add butter, salt, pepper and a package of spaghetti. Just before taking up[,] add a cup of cream and cover the top with a rich paste and boil a few minutes more. This is a good way to use the boney parts of a chicken." (13) (Okay, so this recipe is nearly as confounding as the first, but at least it includes some liquid to cook the spaghetti. The paste is never explained. Later recipes would reduce chicken broth and canned tomatoes to a paste, so perhaps this is reference to tomato paste.)</p>

            <p>Neither of the 1926 recipes would become iconic, and it is clear from the New Augusta cookbook's dueling recipes that Mississippians' ideas about chicken spaghetti were still developing. In fact, the cookbook committee included not only a chicken and spaghetti recipe, but a ham and spaghetti recipe as well, suggesting that even the chicken was still up for grabs. (The ham variation was a casserole, although that term was not used, that featured two layers of spaghetti covered with ground ham and cheese and topped with butter and a cup of sweet milk. (14))</p>

            <p>The earliest recipes featured variants of a white sauce, but some later versions featured both a white and a red sauce. The chicken spaghetti prepared by Craig Clairborne's mother blended a red tomato meat sauce with a white Béchamel sauce, but as the dish evolved, the white sauce often disappeared and was replaced by cheese (although, truth be told, endless variations continue to be made). The first of these tomato and cheese recipes to appear in a Mississippi community cookbook can be found in the "One Dish Meal" chapter of Tchula, Mississippi's <em>Our Favorite Recipes</em> created by the Parent Teachers Association in 1946. In this recipe (credited to Mrs. V. H. Gordin of Canton, Mississippi, a town fifty miles south of Tchula), a hen is covered in water and boiled "until ready to fall off the bone." The chicken is then removed from the stock and 3 cans of tomatoes, 2 onions, 2 bell peppers, 1 stack of celery, "1 button garlic," and three bay leaves are added. This mix is cooked "slowly, about five hours, until a 'well done' paste." The chicken is then cut up and added, the spaghetti cooked separately (ignoring the one-dish promise of the chapter) and then spaghetti and paste are placed in a casserole and covered with cheese (adding a third dish to this one-dish meal). Cooks are instructed to "bake until cheese is melted and spaghetti is hot." (89-90)</p>

            <p>As the dish became more popular, "Chicken Spaghetti" emerged as favored name for the dish and it was these simply titled dishes, regardless of the exact recipe, that we used to examine chicken spaghetti's rising popularity. Using a customized database of recipes extracted from over one hundred Mississippi community cookbooks digitized by University Libraries at Southern Miss, Suwan Aryal and I were able to trace the history of chicken spaghetti in Mississippi and compare its popularity to a venerable Southern favorite, fried chicken.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> Although variations on chicken spaghetti were prepared prior to World War II, the dish gained its name and became a household favorite in the 1940s.</p>

            <p>Given that the first appearance of the dish with the title "Chicken Spaghetti" did not appear in our dataset of Mississippi community cookbook until 1946, chicken spaghetti's rapid rise is remarkable. It immediately surpassed the number of fried chicken recipes in the database. It was so popular that many postwar Mississippi community cookbooks included two or three recipes for the dish and at least one, <em>A Book of Favorite Recipes</em> published by the Warren County Home Demonstration Clubs in 1961, included four. In fact, its postwar popularity was so great that despite getting a late start, chicken spaghetti is the only entrée to appear in our list of the ten recipes most often included in Mississippi community cookbooks published from 1900 to 1970. All the other recipes were for desserts.</p>

            <p>Numerous factors contributed to chicken spaghetti's meteoric rise. Initially, at least, it parallelled Americans' embrace of pasta. Once viewed as a detested, even unsanitary immigrant food, macaroni benefited from the concerted efforts of American manufacturers and the U.S. government in the first third of the twentieth century to market it as a healthy, American product made from domestic Durum wheat. (<a href="https://scholarworks.wm.edu/items/0d9a2b0f-b327-435e-93ad-1d58b629ff00" target="_blank">Melissa Faith Gray</a>, 85-94) Grocery stores carried pasta packaged in sanitary boxes featuring recipes and pastoral scenes prior to World War I, and spaghetti and other macaroni dishes became increasingly popular in the decades that followed. (<a href="https://scholarworks.wm.edu/items/0d9a2b0f-b327-435e-93ad-1d58b629ff00" target="_blank">Gray</a>, 85-94; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Are-What-Eat-Americans/dp/0674001907" target="_blank">Donna Gabaccia</a>, 68, 159) In Mississippi, spaghetti dishes moved from the vegetable section of community cookbooks in the 1920s to the entrée section (with meat sauce or meatballs) in the 1950s.</p>

            <p>Shortages and inflation during the Great Depression and World II probably fueled chicken spaghetti's popularity, although the relative dearth of community cookbooks published in Mississippi during the national crises makes this a little difficult to trace. However, domestic mass production of macaroni made it an inexpensive and filling staple in many homes, and, although meat was often scarce and expensive, chicken—still raised in the backyard in many rural areas and small towns—was, at least compared to other meats, available. (As Clairborne noted in his <a href="https://us.amazon.com/Craig-Claibornes-Feast-Made-Laughter/dp/0030640075" target="_blank">autobiography</a>, chickens were "depression food." (29))</p>

            <p>Chicken spaghetti was not only inexpensive and relatively easy to prepare, it also was appealing to young people, including the young Craig Claiborne. In the postwar baby boom, as women found themselves caring for more children (and, in many places in Mississippi, also working), simple and kid friendly foods like chicken spaghetti were popular. And unlike fried chicken, a tried-and-true favorite that every young woman would have learned to cook from her mother or Black servant, chicken spaghetti was new enough that people were eager to share their recipes.</p>

            <p>Chicken spaghetti's relative popularity compared to fried chicken also reflected the marginalization of southern cooking in Mississippi in the postwar years. Southern dishes remained popular, but in middle-class community cookbooks, the percentage of recipes that were Southern declined compared to non-Southern dishes. (This topic is explored more extensively in the larger book project.) Foreign, ethnic, and ethnically influenced dishes became increasingly popular in Mississippi as home cooks embraced national trends.</p>

            <p>Chicken spaghetti's rise, however, involved more than its low price, simple recipes, and kid fandom. The dish was not just beloved, but transformed into a native Mississippi dish, even though nothing about the dish is rooted in the state's culinary traditions. (Mississippi, for example, was not home to a significant number of Italian immigrants.) Many years ago, at a talk I gave at a public library on "ethnic American" food in Mississippi, one of the audience members approached me afterwards and told me she was a bit puzzled by my claims that Mississippians embraced ethnic cuisine because she never really thought of spaghetti as an Italian dish. Chicken spaghetti, it seems, had shed its ethnic origins. In a fascinating dissertation, <a href="https://scholarworks.wm.edu/items/0d9a2b0f-b327-435e-93ad-1d58b629ff00" target="_blank">Melissa Faith Gray</a> argues that the "confluent messages of government agencies, home economists, and business" in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s succeeded in marginalizing pasta's ethnic origins and promoting it as simply a healthy, adaptable staple, but advertisers reversed course in the post-World War II era and reintroduce it as an Italian food. (101) Chicken spaghetti, already emerging as a regional favorite, seems to have retained its local, non-ethnic identity.</p>

            <p>That transformation might help explain its popularity. As the dish was localized, it was also whitewashed. My forthcoming book explores the growing popularity of ethnic dishes in Mississippi and, in general, the Mississippi women who created community cookbooks were eager to embrace new, exotic ethnic recipes. This cosmopolitan attitude contributed to the success of other Italian dishes, from Italian spaghetti recipes to ravioli, but there was probably a ceiling that limited the success of these dishes. When "chicken spaghetti" became "Mississippi chicken spaghetti," its popularity soared. Meanwhile, fried chicken was suffering from the opposite problem. Following the war, Southern women claimed "southern cooking" as their own, ignoring and minimizing the role of Black cooks (an argument I explore more fully in the book, but that others, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Other-Womens-Kitchens-1865-1960/dp/1469606860" target="_blank">Rebecca Sharpless</a>, have written eloquently about). That whitewashing of Black food included fried chicken, but its long association with Black cooks and Black stereotypes may have made the associations with African American culinary traditions difficult to shake. Craig Claiborne's mother made chicken spaghetti her signature dish, but her Black cook, Blanche, prepare the fried chicken. (<a href="https://us.amazon.com/Craig-Claibornes-Feast-Made-Laughter/dp/0030640075" target="_blank">Craig Clairborne</a>, 29)</p>

            <p>In Mississippi, as the origins of chicken spaghetti blurred, it became a local dish popular at backyard barbeques and church picnics—and the most popular entrée in Mississippi community cookbooks published before 1970. For many, including <em> <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/recipes/chicken-spaghetti-casserole-recipe" target="_blank">Southern Living</a></em>, "Chicken spaghetti is a Mississippi original."</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">We had picked the pecan up on half. Since we had four sacks, I had expected Mr. Wheeler to give us two of them. But instead he measured them out, gallon for gallon, to make sure we didn’t have an once more than he did. He kept us there for two hours measuring the pecans. . . . That Saturday morning Mama and Raymond drove the pecans to Woodville, where they could get eighteen cents a point instead of the fifteen cents they got paid in Centreville. In all we had picked up a hundred and twenty dollars’ worth. Mama used the money to buy school clothes for us—shoes, dresses, and pants.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-1" id="pp1-ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> Anne Moody</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps the most distinctly southern pie is the pecan pie. . . .Children were sent out to gather the pecans that fell, and when mixed with the farm dairy products and corn syrup that were in every southern cupboard, the nuts produced a rich dessert.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-2" id="pp1-ref-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> Angie Mosier</p>

            <p>As anyone who has every made the mistake of accepting an invitation to Thanksgiving dinner at my house will attest, I am not a good pie maker. This is in part due to a lack of trying. I generally only bake one or two pies each year and I make them for Thanksgiving. My wife, a very skilled former professional chef, has no interest in baking pies, so despite my lack of talent, it falls to me to uphold the grand tradition of Thanksgiving pie making. I make my own crust, which generally requires a well-swung cleaver to cut, and fill the cement-like creation with whatever kooky, experimental recipe was featured in the <em>New York Times</em> in the run-up to the holiday. No one ever asks to take a slice home with them.</p>

            <p>So nothing about my early morning, early November adventure in pie making was expected or, perhaps, welcomed, but I was obsessed. It started with a simple fact. Suwan Aryal and I have assembled a database of recipes extracted from the over 100 Mississippi community cookbooks published before 1970 digitized by The University of Southern Mississippi. The data shows that the most common recipe is for pecan pie. As such, pecan pie seemed like a topic worth investigating, although most of my historical food writing to date has focused on the lives of those who make and eat food, rather than specific recipes. To my surprise, the story of pecan pie turned out to be more akin to a Dan Brown novel than a Mark Bittman cookbook.</p>

            <p>The twisted tale of the pecan pie would also, also unexpectedly, reaffirm what I have come to understand about American cooking in the twentieth century while working on book about community cookbooks. It is a story of homemakers and innovation, the shifting meanings we attach to food, and the development of a national cuisine.</p>

            <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid var(--border); margin: 2rem 0;">

            <p>Pecan trees are native to Mississippi (as well as other states in the Mississippi River Valley and Texas), but it was not until the late nineteenth century that new cultivation techniques produced consistent, large, and easily shelled nuts.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-3" id="pp1-ref-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> One of the most successful of these new trees produced “paper shell” pecans and was bred, nursed, and sold commercially by Colonel William R. Stuart of Ocean Springs in Jackson County, Mississippi. The Stuart Pecan Company successfully marketed both its trees and its nuts at events like the 1893 Columbian Exposition, and was soon supplying trees throughout the South.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-4" id="pp1-ref-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> Rival nurseries sprang up in Jackson County and by 1920 there were thirty-two nurseries—the largest which “contained more than 13,000 young pecan trees”—and new competitors in states across the South.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-5" id="pp1-ref-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> Encouraged by agricultural scientists eager to find ways to diversify Southern crops, farmers planted pecan orchards from Georgia to Texas.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-6" id="pp1-ref-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup></p>

            <p>The boom in pecan production was as much a real estate boondoggle as an agricultural revolution. Following the well-tread path of speculators who sold satsuma and tung oil orchards, investors seized upon the opportunities the newly cultivated trees presented. As food historian Andrew Smith writes:</p>

            <div class="professor-voice">
              <p>At the time, the cotton crop in the South was devastated by the boll weevil, and property values had collapsed. Northern companies purchased vast acreage in the South, planted paper shell pecans, and sold sections of the plantings as investments. One company that excelled at this was the Oak Ridge Pecan Company, based near Chicago. It purchased land in Florida and then sold it at a substantial profit. . . . Another Chicago-based land scheme was the Mobile Farm Land Company, which sold paper shell pecan acreage around Mobile, Alabama. It offered an Assured Income for Life and a Home for Retirement Adjoining a City of 75,000 People on the Gulf Coast.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Yet another company that engaged in land speculation was headed by Elam G. Hess, the president of the Keystone Pecan Company in Manheim, Pennsylvania. It was formed in 1912, when he acquired 10,500 acres of land near Albany, Georgia, and planted 20 trees to the acre, for a total of 210,000 trees.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-7" id="pp1-ref-7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup></p>
            </div>

            <p>As more acreage was planted, the ready availability of inexpensive pecans increased and pecan consumption rose, but the success of the new industry was not guaranteed. As historian James McWilliams writes, “With supply as high as it was, producers would have to rely on the culinary creativity of American cooks and consumers to persuade Americans to eat pecans as a staple product.”<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-8" id="pp1-ref-8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup> Not all of the early uses succeeded. While health food advocates, especially vegetarians such as Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, promoted nuts as an alternative to meat, efforts to market these health products often failed. Kellogg sold pecan butter as an alternative to peanut butter, for example, but few liked the taste. Similarly, hopes that pecans might produce a cooking oil also amounted to nothing.</p>

            <p>By the turn of the century, Andrew Smith writes, “about 75 percent of the commercial pecans were sold as salted nut meats—whole kernels in one piece, halves, or pieces—and were supplied to restaurants and hotels and for home consumption.”<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-9" id="pp1-ref-9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup> Most of these pecans were eaten as loose nuts, although some found their way into salads and turkey stuffing and some candies.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-10" id="pp1-ref-10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> Though a popular recipe for pecan cake circulated at the turn of the century and Fannie Farmer advocated for pecan brownies in her 1896 cookbook, pecan recipes rarely seemed to capture the nation’s culinary imagination. Pecan consumption was second only to walnuts, and they were particularly popular in the South, but despite the federal government’s promotion of nuts as a meat alternative during voluntary rationing during World War I, the market was not growing as fast as the rapidly maturing pecans orchards could produce nuts.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-11" id="pp1-ref-11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup></p>

            <p>There was one success story, pralines. Originally called “plarines,” the sugary candies were sold by Black women street vendors in New Orleans. The candies were the marriage of native pecans gleaned from trees around the city and low-quality sugar produced in the cane fields around New Orleans. Since the Civil War, at least, they were created and sold by Black entrepreneurs who hawked them as a cheap, high-calorie snack for freed Black labors and later as a sweet treat for New Orleanians. When the availability of inexpensive, cultivated pecans increased in the late nineteenth century, white candy manufacturers seized the opportunity to cater to the increasingly lucrative tourist trade. They rebranded the Africa-inspired candy, fabricated a history that traced the origins of the praline (and its name) to French royalty, and systematically drove Black women from the marketplace. Visitors to New Orleans loved the pecan candies and soon recipes were appearing in newspaper columns and cookbooks. As Anthony Stanosis writes in his recent book on the invention of the New Orleans praline tradition, “by the 1920s, the term ‘pralines’ had become synonymous in the United States with the use of pecans.”<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-12" id="pp1-ref-12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup></p>

            </div>

            <p>Pralines’ success in New Orleans led to some of the earliest recipes for pecans in our database. <em>The Laurel Cook Book</em>, originally published in 1900, includes a recipe for New Orleans Pecan Pralines.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-13" id="pp1-ref-13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup> Likewise, <em>Tried and True</em> from Gulfport, Mississippi, published in 1906 includes a recipe for “Nut Candies” that allows for the use of pecans or walnuts. The cookbook also includes a recipe for “Candies” that, in addition to the standard praline ingredients, features a small amount of chocolate. Both these cookbooks are from southern Mississippi and both communities had strong connections to New Orleans.</p>

            <p>If the pecan industry was to thrive, however, it would need more than pralines. Low prices encouraged both pecan growers seeking to increase demand and housewives eager to exploit the inexpensive nut to develop new recipes. The most successful of these new recipes—at least until Bordon’s introduction of pecan praline ice cream in the 1950s—was pecan pie.</p>

            <p>Pecan pie seems to have made its first appearance following the Civil War. Andrew Smith observes that the first “located” recipes appeared simultaneously in <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> and <em>Texas Siftings</em> on February 6, 1886.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-14" id="pp1-ref-14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup> Other recipes soon followed in regional and national publications. These recipes plopped a handful of pecan pieces into or on top of a custard base and covered the whole with a meringue. The resulting pie was similar to a host of other contemporary pies, most notably chess pie (sometimes called transparent pie), whose first located recipes appeared in print twenty years before the first recipes for pecan pie.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-15" id="pp1-ref-15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup> Some of the recipes were simple, containing nothing more than cream, sugar, eggs, and pecans, but some also included flour, butter, and flavorings such as vanilla.</p>

            <p>Although custard pecan pie recipes began appearing in cookbooks, the dessert was not especially popular. Neither Fannie Farmer’s 1896 <em>Boston School of Cooking Cook Book</em> nor Sarah Rorer’s 1902 <em>New Cook Book</em> nor <em>Good Housekeeping’s</em> 1909 <em>Woman’s Home Cook Book</em>, three of the most popular cookbooks of the early twentieth century, included the recipe. <em>The Settlement Cook Book</em>, published in 1901, also ignored pecan pie. To be fair, none of these cookbooks included a large number of pie recipes. Pies had fallen out of fashion in the late nineteenth century, criticized by nutritionists as heavy and indigestible.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-16" id="pp1-ref-16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup> Mrs. Rorer, in particular, was a famed critic of pies, although she did publish one of the earliest recipes for pecan pie identified with a specific place in 1898. “Texas Pecan Pie,” a custard pie submitted by “M.G.,” was included in a rather long list of random recipes Rorer featured in her column in the <em>Ladies Home Journal</em>.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-17" id="pp1-ref-17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup> Reflecting the tepid reception the custard version of pecan pie enjoyed, our database contains only one pecan pie recipe prior to the late 1920s. It is called simply “Nut Pie.”<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-18" id="pp1-ref-18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup></p>

            <p>It will come as no surprise to those who love a slice of gooey, sugary pecan-laden pie that the nineteenth-century custard pie failed to become a holiday favorite. And it is the story of this pie’s failure and the rise of its much more popular corn-syrup successor that led me, in a rather roundabout way, to cajole my beleaguered spouse into helping me bake a pecan pie on a Sunday morning weeks before Thanksgiving. Like many a food historian before me, I had become obsessed with the twisted tale of the rise of what historian Rebecca Sharpless calls “pecan pie as we know it.”<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-19" id="pp1-ref-19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup></p>

            <p>For many years, the story of the invention of the modern pecan pie, like that of the praline, has been simple, straightforward, and fake. This fabricated history was created by the makers of Karo corn syrup, who claimed that the “mixture of corn syrup, sugar, eggs, vanilla and pecans baked in a pie shell” to produce “the now classic Pecan Pie . . . destined to become a world class favorite” was discovered in 1930 by the wife of a corporate sales executive. It is not entirely clear to me when the company first made this claim—it does not show up in advertisements I have examined through the 1960s—but the company continues to promote this story on their foodservice website (although they no longer include it on their retail site).<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-20" id="pp1-ref-20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup></p>

                   class="analysis-chart">
            </div>

            <p>A number of scholars, most notably Rebecca Sharpless, Rossi Anastopoulo, and Sarah Wassberg Johnson, have debunked this story. They have documented recipes for corn-syrup pecan pie, the “now classic Pecan Pie,” printed in cookbooks before 1930 when Karo claims the recipe was invented.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-21" id="pp1-ref-21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup> Our database of Mississippi community cookbooks includes evidence of this as well. The <em>Vicksburg Floral Club Cook Book</em> of 1928 has a recipe for corn-syrup pecan pie and the <em>Greenville Home Economist Cook Book</em> of 1930 has two. And there is also ample evidence that bakeries were making corn-syrup pecan pie prior to its alleged invention by a Karo employee’s wife. As Rebecca Sharpless writes, Karo was being used by commercial bakers in the Mississippi Delta in the 1920s.</p>

            <div class="professor-voice">
              <p>In Memphis in 1929, Vieh Bakeries sold “everyone’s favorite, Vieh’s Karo Pecan Pie, made of pure Karo Syrup, full of pecans” for thirty-three cents. Down the road in Clarksville, Mississippi, the Delta Baking Company offered its Large Karo Pecan Pie for forty cents. And over in Shreveport in 1930, Big Chain’s Balcony Cafeteria sold “Our Delicious Karo Pecan Pie” for ten cents a slice. So clearly PPAWKI [pecan pie as we know it] was a thing in the South by the late 1920s.<sup><a href="#pp1-footnote-22" id="pp1-ref-22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup></p>
            </div>

            <p>If the Karo story is a fiction and Karo did not invent the modern pecan pie, who did? Simple as the question is, and despite some considerable ink spilled by those looking for the holy grail of golden syrup, there is no easy answer. As writers of mystery novels might say, the “plot thickens,” and that seems an equally adapt way to describe the convoluted and controversial story of how our ancestors’ runny custard pie was abandoned and gooey, corn-syrup pecan pie assumed its identity. So, like a mystery novel, this first installment of our tale ends with a cliffhanger. (I promise part two will offer you an answer, and although it is neither simple nor definitive, it will explain why I made that pie.)</p>

          <div class="essay-inner">
            <p>Let’s start with the known facts. Pretty much all the forensic analyses of the origins of the modern pecan pie agree that it was inspired by a number of previous recipes, including the custard pecan pie and other custard and syrup pies such as chess, sugar, and molasses pie (as well as fashionable variations such as Jeff Davis Pie, Tyler Pie, and plantation pie). Molasses pie, a New England favorite with a long history that may stretch back to England, is possibly the mother pie, but since the term molasses was used widely to describe various sugar syrups from maple to cane, it is difficult to trace the evolutions of these various pie histories and draw anything like a straight line from molasses to pecan pie. A probable intermediary step from molasses pie to pecan pie was, I should think, the plantation pie, a molasses pie that was included in some influential Southern cookbooks. Martha Pritchard Stanford’s <em>The Old and New Cook Book</em>, a New Orleans cookbook published in 1904 that received favorable press, featured a recipe for plantation pie that called for boiling sugar, molasses [in this case, probably cane syrup], and butter, cooling the mixture, adding eggs, lemons juice, and flour, pouring it into a crust, and baking.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-1" id="pp2-ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> Exactly what role plantation pie played in inspiring pecan pie is not clear, but there is little question, given that corn syrup is what made the modern pecan pie easy to make and phenomenally popular, that the availability of canned sugary syrups were critical to the modern pecan pie’s success. Exactly who invented the modern syrupy pecan pie, when it happened, and where it happened is, however, is a sticky mess of a mystery.</p>

            <p>One theory dates the first modern pecan pie to at least 1900 and was offered by Rebecca Sharpless in a blog post for UNC Press. Sharpless identified two recipes from the 1920s, discussed below, that use corn syrup, but her research led her to think that there must be a syrupy precursor to those recipes and her search for the progenitor led her to Slidell, Louisiana.</p>

            <div class="professor-voice">
              <p>Into the computer I went one more time, and I hit pay dirt with <em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes Used in the South for More than 200 Years</em>, a slender volume that appeared in the Crescent City in 1900. The compilers are anonymous and there isn’t much on the cookbook’s origins. But there on page 47 is the proof: a pecan pie made with eggs, sugar, “Louisiana syrup,” pecans, butter, vanilla extract, and pecan halves. The cookbook editor noted, “The little lumber town out of Orleans, seems to be the original home of pecan pie. Signs all over Slidell advertise the pecan pie and many New Orleanians drive out to buy them during the season.” The pie uses cane syrup, not Karo, but it’s very close to PPAWKI [pecan pie as we know it]. So. Slidell. Cane syrup. 1900.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-2" id="pp2-ref-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
            </div>

            <p>There are many reasons to believe that Louisiana was the birthplace of the modern pecan pie and that cane syrup preceded the use of corn syrup. Louisiana was one of the few cane sugar producing places in the United States and numerous popular New Orleans recipes featured the local sugar crop, including the brown sugar in pralines and the cane-syrup molasses in plantation pie.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-3" id="pp2-ref-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> There are also examples of cane syrup, rather than corn syrup, being used as the base ingredient in pecan pie, although those examples date to later in the twentieth century. An article titled “Best Pie—Pecan—Comes Out of South” that appeared in an Alabama newspaper in the 1950s, for example, implied that the cane sugar pie was the truest version of a Southern pecan pie and provided a recipe.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-4" id="pp2-ref-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> Yet, I found the story of pecan pie originating in Slidell surprising and decided to do a little more investigating.</p>

            <p>I live in southern Mississippi, about an hour from Slidell, Louisiana, and I’ve stopped, shopped, and explored the city a little over the years. Slidell was founded in the early 1880s when a railroad was built that crossed the Lake Pontchartrain to connect New Orleans to Meridian, Mississippi, and it borders Mississippi. Both Slidell and New Orleans have historically strong cultural and culinary connections to southern Mississippi, so it seemed likely that if neighboring Slidell had become a mecca for pecan pie, Mississippians would have taken note. However, only one recipe for pecan pie made exclusively with cane sugar appears in our community cookbook database and not until 1954.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-5" id="pp2-ref-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> There are a few rare recipes that use cane syrup alongside corn syrup, such as Amy Brister’s Favorite Pecan Pie from the 1950 <em>Circle Fare</em> cookbook published in Jackson, Mississippi, but in Bruster’s recipe the cane syrup seems to have been added for taste. Her recipe calls for a 1/4 cup of cane syrup and a 1/2 cup of karo. The only contemporary pecan pie in the database, described as a nut pie, is a custard pie from Laurel.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-6" id="pp2-ref-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup></p>

            <p>In contrast to Slidell’s pecan pie, pralines had quickly made their way from New Orleans to Mississippi and, as previous noted, appear in two early community cookbooks from Laurel and Gulfport in southern Mississippi. Wealthy folks in cities like Laurel traveled through Slidell along the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad when they visited New Orleans and would seemingly have encountered the rural town’s pie sellers. (There is even a famous story of notoriously poor cook in Laurel who once ordered dinner be brought from New Orleans via train when she was entertaining.) If New Orleans (by way of Slidell) was famous for its pecan and cane sugar pies, why was there no evidence, not even an echo, of that history in Mississippi?</p>

            <p>Equally problematic was that cane syrup manufacturers in New Orleans had not seized upon the Slidell recipe to promote their product. Penick & Ford was founded in Shreveport, Louisiana, but moved to Harvey, just south of New Orleans, where they produced cane syrup molasses under the Brer Rabbit brand name beginning in 1907.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-7" id="pp2-ref-7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup> Their syrups were widely marketed as a product of “Old New Orleans” with its “luscious old-plantation flavor of Louisiana cane sugar,” but there is little evidence that they promoted their syrup as useful in the making of pecan pie (although they eventually included a pecan pie in their 1930s promotional cookbook).<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-8" id="pp2-ref-8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup> That’s not to say that Brer Rabbit ignored pie makers; they featured a recipe for molasses pie in their advertising as early as 1921 and continued to promote the pie for years.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-9" id="pp2-ref-9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup></p>

            <p>A closer look at the editor’s note in <em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes</em> raised additional questions. In 1900, when <em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes</em> was apparently published, there were fewer than 10,000 automobiles on the road in the United States and no direct roadway between New Orleans and Slidell. There was a railroad bridge, but the Watson-Williams Pontchartrain Bridge, which linked the two Louisiana communities, was not built until 1928. Yet the editor’s note in the “1900” cookbook implied that it was motorists, not train passengers, making the trek to Slidell to purchase its famous pies. “Signs all over Slidell advertise the pecan pie,” the cookbook states, “and many New Orleanians drive out to buy them during the season.”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-10" id="pp2-ref-10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> It is possible, of course, that the 1900 copyright referenced a first printing and the cookbook editor added a note to a later edition without updating the copyright, but it seemed unlikely.</p>

            <p>All of this led me to think I needed to take a closer look at <em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes Used in the South for More than 200 Years</em>, but before I could locate a copy, I stumbled upon a blog post by Martin Patron, an archivist who works for Cocktail Kingdom, a New York company that manufactures and sells professional barware. The company houses the “largest known collection of antique cocktail books in the world” and their collection includes, according to Patron, numerous copies of <em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes Used in the South</em>, but only one with the copyright date 1900. Patron investigated the history of the cookbook and offered some well researched reasons to believe that the copyright date was fabricated to make the cookbook appear older in order to sell it to tourists. Among other anomalies, the cookbook contains a recipe for a side car, a cocktail not invented until the 1920s. As Patron explains:</p>

            <div class="professor-voice">
              <p>Bottom line: this booklet was printed almost assuredly after Prohibition, but no earlier [than] the 1920s. Most likely, it was printed in the 1930s and compiled by George L. Mayer, a New Orleans businessman, for the local souvenir trade. One of the ways we can put this together is [a civil suit from 1939]. That, and the fact we have a pretty good idea whence came the Side car.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We also know that Peerless Printing was involved with early editions of another book, <em>Gourmet’s Guide to New Orleans</em>, that later moved to a different printer. (We have a few later editions of this in the collection, too, but not one printed by Mayer.)</p>
              <br>
              <p>One might conjecture that once Mayer lost the printing gig for Natalie Scott and Caroline Merrick Jones’ book around 1934, he decided to produce his own similar book. And then he decided to lie about when it was published.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-11" id="pp2-ref-11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup></p>
            </div>

            <p>While it is possible that George L. Mayer acquired an earlier cookbook published around 1900 and reprinted it for tourists, it was becoming increasingly clear that the recipe for pecan pie and the notes about driving out to buy pecan pies in Slidell were added after 1928.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-12" id="pp2-ref-12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup> The cane syrup recipe for pecan pie is just too great an outlier to have come from 1900.</p>

            <p>That does not mean my hunch that Slidell had never been famous for pecan pie was well founded. While Slidell did not establish a national reputation, when I expanded my search to the 1930s, I found a few newspaper references that confirmed Slidell had once been known regionally for its pecan pies. In the early 1930s, the <em>Greenwood Commonwealth</em> in Mississippi provided Greenwood High School an “official page” called “The Bulldog Broadcast.” The page included a gossip column where students poked fun at their teachers and one week it featured this cryptic comment: “And we’ll have you know that Miss Frances Wharton, our dramatic arts teacher, comes from Slidell, La., the town where they use some of their nuts in making the famous pecan pie.”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-13" id="pp2-ref-13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup> Five years later, a recipe for pecan pie was printed in <em>The Tangipahoa Parish Daily Courier</em> published in Hammond, Louisiana. Mrs. Eva Wilcome, a locally celebrated “culinary artist,” provided her recipe for pecan pie made with 3 eggs, 2-3 cups of white Caro [sic], a tablespoon of dark Caro [sic], 1 cup of sugar, and 1 cup of chopped pecans. This recipe, which is more candy than pie, was described by the newspaper as similar to what was prepared in Slidell. “Those of us who have passed through Slidell and eaten pecan pie as it is served there will be glad to add this recipe of Mrs. Wilcombe’s to our cooking book’s fly leaf. Unlike some pecan pie recipes this one makes up into a more or less caramelized pie as contrasted with the custard pre [sic] preferred by some cooks.”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-14" id="pp2-ref-14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup></p>

            <p>Neither the editor’s note in <em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes</em> nor Mrs. Wilcombe’s recipe claims that the recipe offered is the exact recipe used by the famous pecan makers of Slidell. These recipes, however, do help to clarify the debate about the origins of the modern pecan pie. Slidell, it seems, had a regional reputation for making pecan pies (Hammond is about 50 miles from Slidell and Greenwood is a little over 250 miles), but that reputation was not established until the 1930s. And while Slidell’s pies were sugary and sweet, lending credibility to the idea that they may have included large quantities of cane syrup as Sharpless suggested, since Slidell’s reputation for pecan pie blossomed after the first corn syrup pies and we do not have any recipes from Slidell that pre-date the corn-syrup pie, it is not likely (or, at least, not proven) that Slidell’s pie makers influenced the development of the corn-syrup pie. Ultimately, it is not even possible to know whether Slidell’s famous pies were made with corn syrup, cane syrup, or some combination of corn and cane syrup.</p>

            <p>If the modern pecan pie made with syrup was not invented in Slidell around 1900, then the best clues to its origins might be two recipes from 1925, the first two known recipes for modern pecan pie. Rebecca Sharpless located one in a Dallas community cookbook produced by the Sunday school class at First Baptist Church in Dallas. I have not seen this cookbook, but Sharpless describes the recipe as a “pecan pie made with sugar, flour, eggs, pecans, dark Karo, butter, and vinegar.”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-15" id="pp2-ref-15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup> It is a recipe that modern chefs would recognize as pecan pie. Moreover, there are considerable reasons to believe that the modern pecan pie was invented in Texas. Texas was one of the largest growers of pecans in the United States and San Antonio was the site of the nation’s largest pecan processing facilities.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-16" id="pp2-ref-16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup></p>

            <p>Recipe writers, as we shall see, regularly credited both pecan custard pie and pecan corn-syrup pie to Texas.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-17" id="pp2-ref-17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup> In our database, for example, there are three recipes for Texas Pecan Pie, one custard pies and two corn syrup pies, as well as two Texas Pecan Cake recipes. While there is no reason to believe that Mrs. H. W. Woodruff, the woman who submitted the recipe to the First Baptist Church cookbook in 1925, invented the pecan pie with corn syrup, Woodruff’s recipe is one of earliest printed recipes for the new dessert. (Sharpless tried to track down more information on Mrs. Woodruff and believes her first name might have been Margaret, but notes “she has been sadly difficult to track.”)</p>

            <p>Mrs. Woodruff might have been able to claim exclusive title to being the first to submit a corn-syrup pecan pie recipe to a cookbook if it were not for a second recipe, identified by both Rebecca Sharpless and Rossi Anastopoulo. The second recipe’s origins are even murkier than the first, but the recipe was published in 1925 in an advertising cookbook created by Elam G. Hess’ Keystone Pecan Company and the story of the company and its cookbook shed some light on the origins of the modern pecan pie.</p>

            <p>The Keystone Pecan Company, founded in 1912 and located in Manheim, Pennsylvania, was one the many companies that, as Andrew Smith observes (see part one of this essay), “purchased vast acreage in the South, planted paper shell pecans, and sold sections of the plantings as investments.” In the case of Keystone, the company bought land in Georgia, planted twenty pecan trees per acre, and then sold the orchards with the promise that the trees would be maintained, the crop harvested, and the pecans marketed (for a small additional fee). The Pennsylvania company acquired the land for around $25 an acre and sold their orchards for $250 an acre (paid in $10 installments).<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-18" id="pp2-ref-18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup></p>

            <p>Keystone aggressively promoted their orchard shares. They employed local agents to sell shares; advertised, especially in small-town Pennsylvania and nearby New York City; courted the press with attention-grabbing events; and, like similar companies, produced a promotional book in 1915 that touted the health benefits of pecans and featured endorsements from the likes of John Harvey Kellogg.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-19" id="pp2-ref-19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup> Some time in the early 1920s, the company distinguished itself from its competitors with a recipe book designed to stimulate demand for pecans. No copies of “Fifty Proved Pecan Recipes” have survived, as far as I know, but it was enough of a success that in the spring of 1924 the company ran a contest to gather recipes for a new cookbook. The top prize was $25, and the contest was advertised in the <em>Ladies Home Journal</em> and in newspapers from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, California.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-20" id="pp2-ref-20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup> In response, Keystone claimed to have received 21,155 recipes from 5,083 homemakers.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-21" id="pp2-ref-21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup></p>

            <div class="chart-container">

                   class="analysis-chart">
            </div>

            <p>To sort through these recipes and to feed their publicity machine, the company launched the Keystone Pecan Research Laboratory in Manheim in October 1924. Hess purchased a meeting hall often used by the boy scouts, fitted it out with a modern kitchen, and hired a dietician and five other women to test and select the recipes.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-22" id="pp2-ref-22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup> The laboratory quickly winnowed down the submissions and they were published in spring 1925 in <em>800 Proved Pecan Recipes: Their Place in the Menu</em>. Among the hundreds of recipes, was a recipe for molasses pie submitted by Mrs. Gus O. Selbensen, which is arguably the first (or second) published recipe for modern pecan pie.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-23" id="pp2-ref-23" class="footnote-ref">23</a></sup> Curiously, this molasses pie included no “molasses.” Instead, this very modern recipe called for sugar, butter, eggs, flour, salt, almond extract, white Karo syrup, and 1½ cups of pecans.</p>

            <p>Nothing is known of Mrs. Gus Selbensen and efforts to locate historical records have proved fruitless. Nothing in the cookbook indicates where Selbensen lived and, while the surname Selbensen is extremely rare, I have found no evidence of a Mrs. Gus Selbensen in census or newspaper records. It is possible that the laboratory misspelled the name or simply made up a name for a recipe they wanted to include. The title of the recipe is, ultimately, the only clue to the origins of the recipe and it is somewhat ambiguous. The Selbensen recipe evidentially was derived from a recipe for molasses pie. Molasses, as we generally think of it today, is a by-product of sugar production and was a staple of northeast cooking since the colonial era. Recipes for molasses pie were common in the nineteenth century. However, the term molasses, while not generally used for corn syrup, was also used for cane syrup, especially in the South, so the pie’s lineage remains a bit of a mystery.</p>

            <p>If the Selbensen molasses pie recipe played a critical role in the development of the modern pecan pie, its legacy outlasted the company that circulated it. Keystone’s aggressive sales did not spare it from the effects of the Great Depression, and it was “dissolved into the Keystone Orchard Owners with headquarters in Georgia” in 1933 despite efforts to market their pecans under the Patrician Pecan brand. A quixotic effort to produce a health powder called Pecano made of two-thirds pecans and one-third cashews led to lawsuits, a Food and Drug Administration investigation, and the ultimate end of the Hess enterprises in 1938.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-24" id="pp2-ref-24" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup> But before the company collapsed, it widely marketed its cookbook (which Andrew Smith calls the “largest compendium of pecan recipes ever assembled”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-25" id="pp2-ref-25" class="footnote-ref">25</a></sup>). Advertisements for the cookbook, which sold for $2.50 and promoted the health benefits of pecans and its company’s pecan orchard shares, were published in newspapers and magazines from Selma, Alabama, to Porland, Oregon.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-26" id="pp2-ref-26" class="footnote-ref">26</a></sup> As a result, the cookbook developed a following among home bakers and food writers. Articles by local chefs endorsed the cookbook in communities as far flung as San Antonio, Texas, and Cleveland, Ohio.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-27" id="pp2-ref-27" class="footnote-ref">27</a></sup>. Yet it is hard to know how influential the cookbook was and impossible to know if anyone who owned the cookbook ever made Selbensen’s poorly-titled molasses pie. Certainly, Keystone did not recognize how revolutionary its pie recipe would become. Although the company featured several recipes for pies in its advertisements for the cookbook, such as a recipe for raisin pie and Thanksgiving recipes for pumpkin and mince pie, they did not feature the molasses pie that was to upend pie history.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-28" id="pp2-ref-28" class="footnote-ref">28</a></sup></p>

            <p>Ultimately, neither Woodruff’s nor Selbensen’s recipe is likely to be the first recipes for a modern pecan pie—they are simply the first printed records that we have discovered—but both represent the importance of Karo corn syrup in the creation of the pie. That is not surprising since Karo products were heavily marketed. Corn syrup, a derivative of cornstarch, did not “crystalize when heated, so it was particularly useful for dessert and candy-making.” It was mass produced in the nineteenth century and originally sold from barrels in grocery stores.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-29" id="pp2-ref-29" class="footnote-ref">29</a></sup> In 1902, the Corn Products Refining Company branded and packaged corn syrup as Karo Corn Syrup. In 1910, as Rossi Anastopoulo writes in her 2022 book, <em>Sweet Land of Liberty: A History of America in 11 Pies</em> (as excerpted in Slate), the company “launched a massive and unprecedented $250,000 publicity campaign to make Karo a household name.”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-30" id="pp2-ref-30" class="footnote-ref">30</a></sup> World War I provided an additional boost as sugar rationing encouraged consumers to turn to sweet alternatives. Soon Karo could be found in homes across America and homemakers were finding new ways to use the versatile syrup.</p>

            <p>Cane syrup might have preceded it, but the mass marketing of Karo syrup guaranteed it would eventually become the go-to goo in pecan pie. However, like many new ideas, the invention of the modern pecan pie was probably not an epiphany but an evolution. No one, it seems, was especially pleased with the custard pecan pie of yesteryear and housewives experimented with ways to improve the recipe. In a moment of hubris, I went looking a recipe for corn-syrup pecan pie that predated the 1925 recipes discovered by other historians. I did not find it, but I did stumble across a recipe that demonstrates a critical step in the evolution of pecan pie and suggests, although I can’t prove it, that the modern pecan pie was first eaten in Texas.</p>

            <p>In 1916, Mrs. Weck Mears of Menard, Texas, submitted a recipe for Pecan Custard Pie to a community cookbook that was being assembled by the Ladies Auxiliary of Fredericksburg, Texas. Despite the name and a cup of “cream or rich milk,” the recipe struck me as bearing some similarity to the modern pecan pie. In this recipe two cups of sugar are combined with one cup of water and boiled to a syrup and then butter the “size of an egg” is added. The yolks of 4 eggs, 2 teaspoons of cornstarch, and 1 cup of the milk are then combined and mixed with the sugar syrup. The whole is then boiled again until it is thick and then the pecans and flavors are added. It is later topped with a meringue.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-31" id="pp2-ref-31" class="footnote-ref">31</a></sup></p>

            <div class="chart-container">

                   class="analysis-chart">
            </div>

            <p>I’m not an expert cook, but I hypothesized that this recipe—sweetened with a sugar syrup and thickened with cornstarch—might produce something more akin a modern corn-syrup pecan pie than a custard pie. A simple custard pie can be made with eggs, milk, sugar, and a flavoring like vanilla or nutmeg. Older recipes often added butter for flavor and a little flour as thickener. The result is a smooth, eggy custard that can be baked in a pie shell and cut into slices. This recipe is different. It starts with a boiled sugar syrup, and then combines that with an egg and milk mixture thickened with cornstarch (which, I will remind readers, is used in the production of corn syrup). The pie is not baked, unless you top it with meringue. Making a custard with sugar syrup was not the norm and making a custard with cornstarch, although not unheard of, was an expedient that was frowned upon. Another cookbook from the same decade described a custard pie made with cornstarch as a “cheap custard pie.”<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-32" id="pp2-ref-32" class="footnote-ref">32</a></sup> Could the combination of sugar syrup and cornstarch, when boiled, produce something similar to corn syrup?</p>

            <p>There was only one way to know for certain and that was to make the pie. My spouse helped. We used half and half for the “rich milk” and Danielle, the former chef, snuck in a pinch of salt when I was not looking. We probably left it on the stovetop a little longer than necessary in an effort to guarantee it was thick enough, but the result, pictured here, was delicious. Despite the store-bought Pillsbury crust, this is the best pecan pie I’ve ever had. I found the sugar syrup a little less cloying than Karo and the milk made it a little bit creamier, but this very sweet, gooey pie is not a custard pie (to my untrained taste buds). It has both the taste and texture of a modern pecan pie made with corn syrup. And you don’t have to take my word for it. An American friend, who lives in Great Britain where corn syrup is not widely available, made the recipe and said that he would never have guessed it was not made with corn syrup. I am sorry I can’t share a slice with you.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Is this the missing link between pecan custard pie and pecan Karo pie? No, but it is probably one of the many evolutions that eventually produced the modern pecan pie. Perhaps, as the sugar syrup suggests and Rebecca Sharpless thought, it started with cane syrup. Perhaps someone else decided that a simple sugar syrup was easier to secure now that beets were used to make sugar and the price was low. Then someone added flour as a thickener, and someone else decided the recipe was too goopy and substituted cornstarch. These cooks, steeped in the experience that came from making molasses pie, chess pie, plantation pie, sugar pie, vinegar pie, and others, or at least familiar with the techniques used from reading recipes, experimented and innovated and pecan pie slowly evolved. Eventually, Mrs. Weck Mears makes a pie that others compliment, and from there it is only a short hop, skip, and a jump to a pie made with Karo.<sup><a href="#pp2-footnote-33" id="pp2-ref-33" class="footnote-ref">33</a></sup></p>

            <p>Yet, it was not only the recipe for pecan pie that would evolve but also the meaning the pie held for Americans. For more on that story, you will have to read part three.</p>

                  <p><em>A Book of Famous Old New Orleans Recipes</em> was purchased by tourists who shared the recipe, although it does not seem to have encouraged the use of cane syrup over corn syrup. In 1936, a California paper printed some recipes that Mrs. Ernest Zebal collected during her trip to New Orleans. The recipe varies slightly from <em>A Book of Famous New Orleans Recipes</em> (a teaspoon of butter rather than a tablespoon, but that might be a misprint), but the description that Mrs. Zebal provided was clearly cadged from the tourist cookbook: “The little lumber town of Slidell, New Orleans, seems to be the original home of pecan pies and many New Orleanians drive out to buy them during the season.” “Patricia’s Pantry,” <em>Woodland Daily Democrat</em>, August 12, 1936, 2. <a href="#pp2-ref-12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p>

            <p>The Mississippi Community Cookbook Project’s experimental AI database does not provide much additional insight into the origins of the pecan pie, but it does provide some evidence of the pie’s popularity and the nation’s embrace of this dessert. The number of Pecan Pie recipes in our database alone demonstrates how quickly pecan pie’s popularity rose once custard gave way to corn syrup. Even though the first corn syrup recipes for pecan pie do not appear in our database until 1928—and there were only four recipes published in the 1930s—pecan pie recipes are the most numerous recipes in our digitized collection of over 100 Mississippi cookbooks (around 20,000 recipes) published before 1970. (And it was not just pecan pie that flourished. As James McWilliams observes, the post-Depression, postwar era launched a “pecan-dessert craze” characterized by “diversity and creativity . . . emblematic of a uniquely American way of eating—one that was not bound by strict culinary traditions and was open to virtually any reasonable (or not) form of innovation.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-1" id="pp3-ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>)</p>
            
            <p>The embrace of pecan pie with corn syrup, often specifically identified as Karo syrup, is readily apparent in the recipes that Mississippi cooks shared, although a small but significant number of recipes for the custard variety still appeared in these cookbooks. In some cases, the adoption of Karo was not only reflected in the ingredient lists but also the titles of the recipes (although contrary to Karo’s foodservice website, in our database it was always some version of Karo Pecan Pie and not simply Karo Pie<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-2" id="pp3-ref-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>). Mrs. E. V. Hirsch called her pie recipe Karo Pecan Pie in the <em>Home Economist Cook Book</em> created in Greenville in 1930. Three others did the same in 1946. Twice in 1947 and once each in 1948 and 1949, Karo appears in the recipe’s title and Karo Pecan Pie was the title chosen an additional twenty-two times in the two decades that followed. But as the number of pecan pie recipes rose, mostly made with corn syrup, the Karo in the name started to feel unnecessary. By the mid-1950s, in fact, Patsey Hailes, the reigning Miss Moselle of Moselle, Mississippi, felt it necessary to call her recipe Pecan Pie without Karo to distinguish it from what was now standard.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-3" id="pp3-ref-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup></p>

            <p>Recipe titles also provide insight into the perceived, if not the actual, origins of these recipes. Initially when pecan pie was associated with a place, it was often associated with a state and the state with the most probable claim to have been the site of its invention, Texas, was also the most recognized in our database. Texas had a long history with pecans and in the first few decades after pecan production took off in the early twentieth century, Texas dominated the trade.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-4" id="pp3-ref-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> Although Texas was never as closely linked to pecan pie as Boston was to beans, Maryland to crab, or New Orleans to pralines, it was not uncommon for pecan pie to be referred to as Texas Pecan Pie. M.B.’s recipe published by Sarah Rorer in 1898 in the <em>Ladies Home Journal</em> was titled Texas Pecan Pie and in our database of Mississippi cookbooks, the association was made three times—in 1958, 1964, and 1968.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-5" id="pp3-ref-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> In the national press, Texas was associated with pecan pies sporadically, but more often than other states.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-6" id="pp3-ref-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup> In 1940, for example, <em>Woman’s Day</em> ran an article on regional specialties titled “Fine American Cooking” and justified Texas’s claim to pecan pie by noting that “Texas produces far more pecans than any other state.” Curiously, <em>Woman’s Day</em>’s editors described the submission by Mrs. James D. Claitor of Galveston, Texas, as a “very unusual recipe for Pecan Pie,” although recipe was for the standard custard pecan pie that everyone would have made only fifteen years earlier.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-7" id="pp3-ref-7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup></p>

            <p>Although an article in <em>Town and Country</em> on the lives of elite Texans in 1957 made passing reference to pecan pie being a Texan “specialty,” the association between the Lone Star state and pecan pie waned and seemed destined to fade away until the tragic events of 1963.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-8" id="pp3-ref-8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup> The ascendance of Lyndon Baines Johnson, a Texan, to the Presidency (along with Texans’ desire to erase their role in his predecessor’s death by celebrating everything good their state) seems to have briefly revived Texas’ claim to pecan pie. Articles on the President’s diet often referenced “popular Texas dishes” such as pecan pie, and the Karo corporation, hoping to exploit the connection between its product and the new President, launched an advertisement for “VIP Pecan Pie” in 1964. The advertisement was illustrated with a pecan pie in a window that overlooked the Capitol building accompanied by the assertion that “Capitol hostesses are finding [VIP Pecan Pie] delightfully easy to make and deliciously proper to serve.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-9" id="pp3-ref-9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup> It was during this revival that two of the three recipes referencing Texas in our database of Mississippi cookbooks were published.</p>

            <p>Before Texas could reassert its title, however, competing claims from states to the east gained a toehold. These new associations had little to do with the specific recipes proffered, as few recipes differed significantly from one to another, but instead were reflections of local pride and journalistic embroidering. On various occasions, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Virginia were all given credit for the excellence of their pecan pies and an article in <em>The Home Garden</em> in 1953 called “Mrs. Paxton’s Mississippi recipe” for pecan pie “the most popular of all.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-10" id="pp3-ref-10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> However, the most substantial challenge to Texas came from Georgia.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-11" id="pp3-ref-11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup> Georgia had developed a vibrant pecan crop and the state’s production often surpassed Texas’ in the 1950s, but the association between pecan pie and Georgia had more to do with tourism than agroforestry.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-12" id="pp3-ref-12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup> Increasing numbers of Americans traveled South during the winter, stopping in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia on their way to Florida, and some were journalists who lauded the territory’s mastery of pecan pie. An article on inexpensive driving holidays in the Southeast noted that for five dollars a day you could eat “all kinds of delicious novelties” from “turtle steak (tastes like veal—has no fish taste)” to pecan pie.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-13" id="pp3-ref-13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup> These experiences translated into the naming of some recipes as “Georgia” pecan pie. A series of articles about “how young America Eats” in the <em>Ladies Home Journal</em> in the 1950s offered a “southern specialties” menu that ended with a “Georgia Pecan Pie” (although the selected entrée, “baked pork chops with beans,” might leave one questioning the thoroughness of the writers’ research).</p>

            <p>Yet the profusion of new state associations did not dethrone Texas so much as it awarded everyone a blue ribbon, ultimately paving the way for the broad embrace of pecan pie as one of the signature dishes of the South as a whole. In the postwar period, references to particular states decreased and references to the southernness of pecan pie increased (with an ill-defined “Deep South” sometimes granted a slightly larger slice of the pie). Of course, there was every reason to associate pecans and the American South. Pecans were native to the South, cultivated in the South, and consumed in greater volume in the South. Pecans had been eaten by the handful long before pecan pie entered the pantheon of great American pies. But relatively few recipe writers made the connection between pecan pie and the South before the arrival of the corn-syrup pecan pie in 1925. A custard pecan pie recipe from 1916 in <em>Good Housekeeping</em> stated that pecan pie was a “favorite in the South and good in any locality,” but a recipe in the same magazine from six years earlier had made no reference to the South. While it is a little surprising that it took so long for a solid consensus to emerge that pecan pie was Southern despite no one arguing otherwise (unless we count the states seeking exclusive claims), the fact that the modern pecan pie owed its existence to a cup of Karo syrup made in a factory outside Chicago by a company headquartered in New York may have muddied the waters.</p>

            <p>This limited association between pecan pie and the former states of the Confederacy changed slowly in the first couple of decades after pecan pie’s status rose with the introduction of Karo syrup pies.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-14" id="pp3-ref-14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup> In part, this may have been a paradoxical response to the national embrace of the dessert. A widely disseminated article on “American Cooking” in 1930 quoted Joseph Wilshire, “who has been identified with the food industry for more than thirty years,” about the emergence of a “a representative American menu fast being adopted in every home.” He claimed that America’s regional dishes had become national and cited Texas Pecan Pie as a prime example.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-15" id="pp3-ref-15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup> And as the dessert gained national status, it seems it was increasingly important to highlight its origins in the South. Pecan pie became a dish not only prepared in the South, but a dessert representative of the South.</p>

            <p>Referencing pecan pie’s regional identity became increasingly common in 1940s, gained further traction in the 1950s (encouraged, perhaps, by the arrival of the Connecticut Pie Company’s frozen “Southern pecan pies” in grocery stores), and was nearly mandatory by the 1960s.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-16" id="pp3-ref-16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup> Two advertisements from Crisco demonstrate how the southernness of Pecan Pie evolved. In 1935, the company featured a recipe for Sally’s Pecan Perfection Pie (made with both Crisco and corn syrup) without any reference to the South. In 1951, ads featured Crisco’s Plantation Pecan Pie (made using Crisco as a substitute for corn syrup) described the pie as an “Old Deep-South Favorite” that “old-time Dixie cooks won fame with,” now made better with Crisco.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-17" id="pp3-ref-17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup></p>

                   class="analysis-chart">
            </div>

            <p>The “old-time Dixie” trope was often invoked. A 1940s series called “So Good Meals” in <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> solicited recipes from across the country. One installment of the series included an image of a Black mammy and observed that recipes from the “Deep South” are “great with memories of generations of family dinners, of faithful dark hands creating tantalizing goodness from simple things.” Pecan pie was not given pride of place among the other “true Southern dishes,” but a recipe was included.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-18" id="pp3-ref-18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup> The “Line a Day” column in <em>Ladies’ Home Journal</em> described pecan pie as the “old South at its sunny best” in 1950 and <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> featured a “luscious pecan pie” in 1953 described as “an old-time favorite of Southern belles and beaux.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-19" id="pp3-ref-19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup> (Further emphasizing regional peculiarities, the magazine provided an alternative recipe that reduced the sugar for those not accustomed to pies this “extra rich and sweet.”)</p> 

            <p>Even if articles did not reference Southern belles, moonlight, or magnolias, the association between pecan pie and the South was axiomatic.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-20" id="pp3-ref-20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup> An article in <em>Seventeen</em> highlighting regional foods, “As American as Our Map,” credited its recipe for pecan pie to the “deep South.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-21" id="pp3-ref-21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup> An article on restaurants in New England explained that the pecan pie featured at the Abner Wheeler house was “borrowed” from “their Southern friends.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-22" id="pp3-ref-22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup> And recipes for pecan pie from the <em>Ladies Home Journal</em>, <em>Woman’s Day</em>, and <em>Good Housekeeping</em>, all called their pies “Southern Pecan Pie.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-23" id="pp3-ref-23" class="footnote-ref">23</a></sup> In a strangest twist, a recipe began to circulate for Yankee Pecan Pie, a recipe presumed to be new, that borrowed its culinary logic from the custard pecan pie of the past and could only be called Yankee in the sense that it was not the corn syrup pie now so firmly associated with the South. As an article from Pampa, Texas, of all places, explained, the Yankee Pecan Pie” differs from the southern version in that the filling is a custard-type mixture made with evaporated milk.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-24" id="pp3-ref-24" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup></p>

            <p>In contrast, in our recipe database, very few contributors opted to describe their recipes as Southern Pecan Pie, perhaps because they thought it unnecessary given that these recipes were printed in Southern community cookbooks, but a few contributors risked overkill and followed the national trend. Mrs. Robert J. Johnson led the way in 1947 with her submission to <em>From Clinton Kitchens</em>, Mrs. H. M. Wise added Southern (and a teaspoon of vanilla) to her recipe in <em>Straight from the Galley</em> in 1952, and Mrs. Zack Buckalew and Mrs. S. S. Allen appended Southern to their recipes in 1954. Mrs. Julia Hewes took it a step further with her Southern Pecan Pie from Georgia submitted to <em>What’s Cookin’</em> in Brookhaven in 1963.</p>

            <p>By the 1960s, there was little ambiguity about the southernness of pecan pie (although, after the Johnsons arrived in the White House, it might also be described as simply Texan). When the <em>Ladies’ Home Journal</em> published a series of articles on regional favorite dishes to promote the publication of a new cookbook, the segment “from The South, Savory Perfection” featured four dishes: Kentucky Chicken, Sally Lunn cake, Ham-and-Sausage Jambalaya, and Southern Pecan Pie (called Southern even in an article on exclusively Southern foods). The rather typical corn-syrup recipe was introduced (along with the other three dishes) as an ageless classic: “Time, tradition and the magic touch of truly magnificent cooks have created the cuisine we relish as Southern and superb.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-25" id="pp3-ref-25" class="footnote-ref">25</a></sup> Nor was the association between pecan pies and the South limited to recipes. Short stories, essays on food, and advice columns nonchalantly linked the South and pecan pie.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-26" id="pp3-ref-26" class="footnote-ref">26</a></sup> A story by Ruth Lyon in <em>Redbook</em> in 1962 titled,”Honey-chile: Why do Perfectly Nice Men Turn into Wolves the Moment They Hear a Girl Say, ‘Y'all’?” described how a young Southern woman is proposition by a fast talking Lothario who proclaims: “Well, well, a Southern belle. What a luscious little piece of pecan pie you are.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-27" id="pp3-ref-27" class="footnote-ref">27</a></sup></p>

            <p>Using the South and nostalgia to sell goods was hardly new.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-28" id="pp3-ref-28" class="footnote-ref">28</a></sup> It was pecan pie that was new and advertisers were eager to invent traditions that would erase any memory of the pre-pecan pie South, create predictable annual sales, and embed the nutty dessert in long-established American rituals. By the 1960s, pecan pie was not only a timeless dessert that everyone was pretty sure grandma made using her grandma’s recipe, but it was fast becoming an essential part of the one of the nation’s most sacred holidays, Thanksgiving.</p>

            <p>Pecans are seasonal and pecan pie was long viewed as a harvest food, but it was not until the corn-syrup pecan pie, simple to prepare and apparently very popular with husbands, that the drumbeat for pecan pie to be considered a holiday staple reached its crescendo.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-29" id="pp3-ref-29" class="footnote-ref">29</a></sup> Efforts to elevate the pie’s standing in the 1920s were limited. In 1920, Libby’s Evaporated Milk featured a recipe for the custardy version of the pie in the New Orleans’ <em>Time-Picayune</em> and promoted it as a Christmas favorite.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-30" id="pp3-ref-30" class="footnote-ref">30</a></sup> Pecans, along with other nuts, were a common holiday treat, and it is probable that pecan pies were served at some Southern Christmas celebrations, but pecan pie was not destined to become a Christmas staple. It was Thanksgiving, the harvest holiday, that emerged as the natural fit, and yet early efforts to associate pecan pie with Thanksgiving also were relatively rare.</p>

            <p>“Gee! I’ll have to make room for that—Pecan Pie,” exclaims a boy spotting a pecan pie cooling in the kitchen in an advertisement that appeared in Alva, Oklahoma’s <em>Daily Review-Courier</em> in November 1926. The advertisement, placed by City Bakery, announced (in all capital letters) “something new!” and advised hosts that they should “mention to members of family and your guests—before they get started on the Thanksgiving dinner—that there will be a delightful treat coming after the turkey. Tell ‘em to ‘leave belt room’ for a generous cut of pecan pie.” Oklahoma, part of the pecan belt and one of the largest producers of native pecans in the United States, was not new to pecans or pecan pie, but it seems that serving a pecan pie at Thanksgiving was worthy of the label “new” in capital letters.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-31" id="pp3-ref-31" class="footnote-ref">31</a></sup> Central Bakery, however, was ahead of its time. Two years later, the Cherry Blossom Cake Shop in San Antonio, another locus of the pecan industry, advertised Pecan Cream Pie (for 40 cents) along with other “Saturday Specials,” but did not include the pie in the section of the advertisement that provided a “gentle reminder for Thanksgiving.” Instead, it recommended customers place Thanksgiving orders for its signature Cherry Blossom Fruit Cake or one of its home-made mince, pumpkin or cranberry pies.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-32" id="pp3-ref-32" class="footnote-ref">32</a></sup> In fact, in the 1920s, when pecan pie was recommended, it featured because it was not a holiday pie. A 1929 article in the Market Basket section of the <em>Oklahoma News</em> observed that serving mincemeat or pumpkin pie before Thanksgiving might lead to the family becoming jaded and “holiday dinner would not be nearly the harvest festival meal without one of both of the pies on the menu.” To avoid this “culinary sin” and still cater to pie-loving family members, the paper recommended serving pecan pie in the weeks before the holiday.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-33" id="pp3-ref-33" class="footnote-ref">33</a></sup></p>

            <p>Still, the tide was turning, especially in the South. In Waco, Texas, the Spring Valley Club Women offered up their favorite “Christmas and Thanksgiving Recipes” and included Mrs. B. W. Lawson’s pecan pie with corn syrup in 1928.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-34" id="pp3-ref-34" class="footnote-ref">34</a></sup> The Tea Room at Maas Brothers in Tampa served up a special Thanksgiving Turkey dinner for 75 cents that ended with Pecan Pie in 1931, and Davidson’s Cafeteria in Springfield, Missouri, suggested you “bring the whole family” to their Thanksgiving meal and, for an additional ten cents, they could have their fill of “pumpkin pie with whipped cream, mince, and pecan pie.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-35" id="pp3-ref-35" class="footnote-ref">35</a></sup> In 1936, Miss Marie Barkley of the University of Kentucky’s home economist department described “desserts such as fruit cake and pecan pie . . . among the real joys of holidays.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-36" id="pp3-ref-36" class="footnote-ref">36</a></sup> Similarly, a syndicated article that provided advice on how to prepare for Thanksgiving dinner boldly suggested pecan pie as the sole dessert claiming it “makes a perfect Thanksgiving dessert” in 1937.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-37" id="pp3-ref-37" class="footnote-ref">37</a></sup></p>

            <p>Many of the initial efforts to embrace pecan pie at Thanksgiving seemed to come from restaurants (perhaps because pecan pie has a rather long shelf life and could be prepared in advance), but some national publications jumped on the pecan-pie bandwagon in the 1930s. <em>Good Housekeeping</em> told readers that “Pecan Pie makes a perfect Thanksgiving dessert, followed by coffee in the living room.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-38" id="pp3-ref-38" class="footnote-ref">38</a></sup> An article in <em>Parents Magazine</em> recommended two corn syrup foods, Texas Pecan Pie and mashed sweet potatoes glazed with butter and corn syrup, for a Thanksgiving dinner that would appeal to both parents and children.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-39" id="pp3-ref-39" class="footnote-ref">39</a></sup> Yet, while some advertisers proclaimed pecan pie as “a perfect ending after a hearty holiday meal,” pecan pie at Thanksgiving was still not the national norm.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-40" id="pp3-ref-40" class="footnote-ref">40</a></sup> In 1940, Camp Beauregard in Pineville, Louisiana, served 11,000 pounds of Thanksgiving turkey to the 11,000 National Guardsmen from Wisconsin and Michigan who were training at the camp. They also served pie. “Pumpkin pie, no stable in Louisiana, appeared on many company menus, vying with the local delicacy, pecan pie which the majority of the soldiers had never heard about.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-41" id="pp3-ref-41" class="footnote-ref">41</a></sup></p>

            <p>Spurred by government efforts to promote pecans as a healthy, domestic “Victory Food Special” during World War II, pecan production rose and prices dropped resulting in a postwar bounty.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-42" id="pp3-ref-42" class="footnote-ref">42</a></sup> Both food manufacturers and homemakers took notice and a part of the postwar reconstruction of civilian life would be the anointing of pecan pie as a Thanksgiving tradition. The <em>Independence, Missouri, Examiner</em> suggested pecan pie as a good alternative to the more traditional pumpkin pie in 1949.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-43" id="pp3-ref-43" class="footnote-ref">43</a></sup> The <em>Vidette-Messenger</em> of Porter County in Valparaiso, Indiana advised readers “it’s time to bring out . . . pecan pie for a Thanksgiving dessert” the same year.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-44" id="pp3-ref-44" class="footnote-ref">44</a></sup></p>

            <p>If the creation of this new holiday tradition came in fits and starts, pecan pie was nonetheless slowly making inroads (often replacing an older tradition of serving fruit cake). Food writers and advertisers advanced the cause considerably by creating and promoting a hybrid pie, pumpkin and pecan, which began to appear in Thanksgiving menus in the 1930s and gained a widespread following as a Thanksgiving alternative in the 1940s and 1950s.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-45" id="pp3-ref-45" class="footnote-ref">45</a></sup> In 1954, the Madison, Wisconsin <em>Capital Times</em> spoke of the pecan-pumpkin pie in glowing terms: “Sometimes there comes along a dessert which receives such acclaim that you tuck it away in your memory for special occasions. . . . Pumpkin Pecan Pie is in keeping with the festive atmosphere of Thanksgiving Day, too. It follows deliciously the old Thanksgiving dinner tradition of pumpkin pie for dessert.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-46" id="pp3-ref-46" class="footnote-ref">46</a></sup> But in the postwar era, hosts increasingly did not have to make excuses for serving pecan pie at Thanksgiving. An article from Louisville, KY, observed that some families might “have your special dessert for this family and truly American meal, but wherever you go you’ll find pecan pie as well as mincemeat and pumpkin.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-47" id="pp3-ref-47" class="footnote-ref">47</a></sup> Mercedes Wheeler, Food Editor for the <em>Daily Oklahoman</em>, agreed. She felt the Oklahoma tradition of a “rich pecan pie” at Thanksgiving had become a “country-wide favorite” and that mincemeat “probably ranks behind pecan and pumpkin pies.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-48" id="pp3-ref-48" class="footnote-ref">48</a></sup> Mrs. Nash certainly seemed to think that was true when she offered her 20-year old corn-syrup pecan pie recipe to readers of the <em>Santa Barbara News-Press</em> in California for an article in which local women “divulge recipes” they planned to use for the Thanksgiving holiday.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-49" id="pp3-ref-49" class="footnote-ref">49</a></sup> Likewise, 1961 photospread for an article on Thanksgiving gives the pecan pie pride of place on a shelf above the other Thanksgiving staples and the suggested menu offered pecan pie as the only dessert.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-50" id="pp3-ref-50" class="footnote-ref">50</a></sup></p>

            <p>The association between pecan pie and Thanksgiving, along with its celebration as the signature dish of the South, invested the pecan pie with new, cultural meanings. Increasingly, Americans spoke about pecan pie as if it had always been preeminent on the Thanksgiving table. A prize-winning Thanksgiving recipe from a newspaper in Oregon in the mid 1930s, when Karo Pecan Pie was only ten years old, spoke of “creole babies ‘with flashing eyes’ that glow with the prospect of eating a slice of that rich old N’Orleans favorite, karo pecan pie!”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-51" id="pp3-ref-51" class="footnote-ref">51</a></sup> A “Southern Pecan Pie” recipe using corn syrup from the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> a few years later was accompanied by the promise that “this rich, golden pecan pie is an old stand-by with southern cooks, and it’s sure to be a favorite with sweet-toothed families and guests.”<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-52" id="pp3-ref-52" class="footnote-ref">52</a></sup> Unapologetically, Mrs. Bruce R. Ikenberry, Virginia’s representative in the 1959-60 Mrs. America pageant, shared her recipe for a “Colonial Innkeeper’s Pecan Pie” made with corn syrup although neither corn syrup nor pecan pie existed in the colonial era. (Mrs. America contestants were judged on their “homemaking skills,” not their knowledge of history, but Mrs. Virginia did not win the national contest.<sup><a href="#pp3-footnote-53" id="pp3-ref-53" class="footnote-ref">53</a></sup>)</p>

            <p>This sense of history and place helped pecan pie fulfill Thanksgiving’s original promise, made in the run-up to the Civil War, to be a holiday that united the North and South. As part of the Thanksgiving meal, pecan pie (along with sweet potatoes) provided regional balance to a holiday with deep New England roots.</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Bangs are rare; whimpers are common. History happens through small changes as people adapt and innovate. That is the story of pecan pie’s invention and its widespread embrace as a signature Southern dish and a Thanksgiving tradition. We may never know if cane syrup was used before corn syrup or who created the modern pecan pie, and despite the time I have spent combining through cookbooks looking for the “big bang” of pecan pie baking, it probably does not matter.</p>

            <p>I stumbled into this project expecting to write a simple tale about why pecan pie was so popular in Mississippi, but the story that has emerged is much more than I expected. The creation of a new pecan pie made with corn syrup demonstrates the creativity of American homemakers. Pecan pie is simple, but collectively thousands of cooks across decades experimented, revised, and reinvented. They did not wait for Karo and company to tell them what worked; they discovered it themselves. It is easy to get nostalgic about food and to treat grandma’s recipe as sacrosanct, but the more you look deeply into the history of cooking the more you realize that grandma did not think her recipe was perfect. Grandma experimented. And we should too.</p>

            <p>The rise of the pecan pie not only reminds us that our most cherished recipes may not be nearly as old as we imagine but also is a warning that our historical memory plays tricks on us. Collective memory, in this case our belief that pecan pie has always been the centerpiece of every Thanksgiving, is rarely an accurate measure of the past, even if it can reveal a lot about the present. If we are craving a colonial pecan pie, it is not just the sugar we are longing for, but also a sense of being part of a stable, unified nation. In making pecan pie, Americans found a modicum of domestic stability that the Cold War’s threat of nuclear destruction endangered. In incorporating that pie into the national cuisine, Americans found unity at a moment when divisions over civil rights threatened to awaken regional discord.</p>

            <p>I should have seen this coming. My forthcoming book on community cookbooks makes similar arguments about the power of local cooks and the emergence of a national cuisine. But, initially, I missed it. I assumed a pecan pie was just a pecan pie, but our foodways are never that simple. What we eat reflects not only who we are, but who we want to be and in the twentieth century, the corn-syrup laden pecan pie offered Americans a gooey, sugary idyll they needed.</p>
